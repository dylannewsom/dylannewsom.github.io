		<h2 class = "sectionhead">Introduction</h1>
		<p id = "intro">Greetings, my name is Dylan Newsom and I am a graduate of Texas A&M University with a B.S 
			in Geographic Information Science and Technology and a minor in Computer Science. I am eager to grow my skillsets and further my career
			as a GIS professional. This website is intended to showcase my past and future academic, personal, and professional work with GIS and programming. I intend to 
			showcase most major academic projects/labs that I feel best represent what I am either proficient or familiar with. I will write about what the project 
			was about, the softwares/programming languages used, what skills I acquired/grew, and what I could work on for next time. Right now, at the start of my career,
			I strive to gain a wide variety of experiences to learn new skills and greatly improve the ones I have. I want to utilize my programming knowledge for GIS
			and I want to gain experience in using programming languages and computer science concepts in conjunction with GIS.
		</p>

		<h2 class = "sectionhead">Skills</h1>
		<p id = "intro">Below I will go through my major listed skills and describe my familiarity and experience with each concept, software, or programming language.
			I hope to convey my current understanding, experience, and my thoughts on my main skills and what I am doing to improve them.
		</p>
		<h2 class = "sectionhead">ArcGIS Pro/ArcMap</h1>
		<p id = "intro">This is the software that I have used the most throughout college and my past internship experience. I am familiar with many of the features
			and geoprocessing tools included in ArcGIS Pro and ArcMap. I have extensive experience in both academic and professional environments using these
			softwares to manipulate and analyze a variety of raster and vector datasets. I have also created geoprocessing workflows using Model Builder in ArcGIS Pro
			to manipulate and visualize data. I feel very confident in my level of understanding of the ArcGIS Pro and ArcMap applications and my ability to understand
			how to manipulate and visualize spatial data using these applications.
		</p>
		<h2 class = "sectionhead">ArcGIS Online</h2>
		<p id = "intro">I have used ArcGIS Online extensively in both academic and professional settings. I have used it to upload and share spatial data, tabular data, web maps,
			and web applications. During my internship at NuStar, I created multiple dashboards using data collected using Survey123. These contained graphs, maps, tables,
			images, and supporting information and allowed for the analysis of the collection of data and the attributes of the data. I combined these dashboards into 
			one application using Experience Builder. I have also created and modified interactive webm aps in ArcGIS Online and have imported layers and maps from ArcGIS Pro
			into ArcGIS Online. There are still many features of ArcGIS Online that I have not yet had the chance to use and explore, and I hope to become more familiar with it and
			use it more in the future.
		</p>

		<h2 class = "sectionhead">Programming</h2>
		<p id = "intro">From classes I took in college, I became familiar with many programming languagees and concepts. I am familiar with 
			Python, C++, Java, Haskell, R, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In C++, Java, and Python, I have learned about and applied advanced data structures and algorithms
			such as linked lists, sort/search algorithms, graphs, trees, queues, recursion, and a variety of other common algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented
			and functional programming concepts and methods. I have a strong desire to strengthen my programming knowledge and prowess and actively try to exercise my 
			skills in Python, C++, and Java specifically. I hope to utilize these skills in my career and contribute in a meaningful way. 
		</p>

		<h2 class = "sectionhead">SQL</h2>
		<p id = "intro">SQL is the language I am the least familiar with as of right now. I have taken one class that taught me basic database concepts
			and SQL queries using SQL Server. I plan to use online resources to become thoroughly acquainted with SQL. I also heavily desire to gain 
			professional experience using SQL and I want it to become a centerpiece of my skillset moving forward.
