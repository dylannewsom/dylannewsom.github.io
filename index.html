		<p id = "intro">Greetings, my name is Dylan Newsom and I am a graduate from Texas A&M University with a B.S 
			in Geographic Information Science and Technology and a minor in Computer Science. I am eager to grow my skillsets and further my career
			as a GIS professional. This website is intended to showcase my past and future academic, personal, and professional work with GIS and programming. I intend to 
			showcase most major academic projects/labs that I feel best represent what I either proficient or familiar with. I will write about what the project 
			was about, the softwares/programming languages used, what skills I acquired/grew, and what I could work on for next time. Right now, at the start of my career,
			I strive to gain a wide variety of experiences to learn new skills and greatly improve the ones I have. I want to utilize my programming knowledge for GIS
			and I want to gain experience in using programming languages and computer science concepts in conjunction with GIS.
